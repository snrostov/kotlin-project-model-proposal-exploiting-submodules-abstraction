requirements:
- all single platform modules should be mpp modules also
    - is should be possible to add another target by just adding `platform {}`
- declaring dependencies to targets should be similar for default target    
- support of custom paltform (i.e. jvm with specific java version)        

migrating from single to multi platform:
- single platform module is just mpp module with one module variant
- `main` and `test` - common source sets

q&a:
- java can be used in common `main` and `test` if module contains only java variants


## current proposal

- primary unit of code organization and dependency resolution is the `module`.
- in simple single platform case `module` provides one artifact that can be consumed by modules that depends on that.
    - that artifact is called `module variant`, that, among other things contains set of it's dependencies 
    - there are different kind of dependencies: api, implementation, api
- provided artifact will be produced by some build pipeline which consist of tasks
- in most cases input of this pipeline is sources and output is set archive

tests:
- by default `module` also produces internal artifact for running `tests`
    - test is private `module variant`? can be optionally published?
  
targets:
- build process configured by defining module variant: `jvm {}`. this things will be crated:
    - source directories `jvm` and `jvm.test`.
     in single platform case there is no reason to use this directories since all code
     it already includes everything from `main` and `test` 
    
sources sets:
- 

- in multi platform case `module` may provide more then one `module variant`
    -
