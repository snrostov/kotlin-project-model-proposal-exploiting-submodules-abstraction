`module` - an application that you can run or library that you can depend on.

Module can have submodules of this types:
- `module` - default basic submodule without access to parent. Parent module has an implicit api dependency on child one, thus it has access to public declarations of child module.
- `inner module` - submodule with access to the parent module public declarations and vice versa. Child module can still have acess to parent internal declarations (but not vice versa). Parent and inner modules always get compiled together. `inner module` derives all settings from parent module (i.e. dependencies, targets, plugins). Currently, `inner modules` may contain only `inner modules` iteself.
- `helper` (tests/integration tests/benchmakrs) - submodule with reversed dependency: helper module is dependent on parent, but not vice versa. Helper module has access to internal declarations from parent module.
- `target`
- `refinement`
