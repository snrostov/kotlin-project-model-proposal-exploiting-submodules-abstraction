#### Traditional modules layout

You can still use traditional modules layout when main and test sources are located side by side (not one into another). In this case you should configure dependencies manually (todo: maybe we can do something for that layout too?).

```
/myApp
    kotlin.mod
    /main
    /test
```

```kotlin
module test {
    import ../main internals
}
```
